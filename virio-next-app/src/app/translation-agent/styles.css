/* 
  This file contained TailwindCSS directives (@import, @theme, @layer).
  In Next.js with the App Router, global styles and Tailwind directives 
  are typically handled in `src/app/globals.css`. 
  
  Component-specific styles can be added here using standard CSS 
  or CSS Modules (e.g., page.module.css).

  The original content seemed to be configuring Tailwind, which should 
  already be set up in your `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.js` 
  if you're using Shadcn UI.

  If you have specific styles for the TranslationAgentPage component, 
  you can add them here. For example:

  .translation-agent-container {
    padding: 1rem;
  } 
*/

/* Add any specific styles for the translation agent page below */
